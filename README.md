# Task Number-5: Neural Style Transfer

This project demonstrates Neural Style Transfer (NST), a deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the style of another. Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (typically VGG19), the model optimizes a new image that preserves the content of the input image while adopting the artistic style of the reference image.

## Repository Features

The repository includes:

1. Implementation of Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch.
2. Support for both content and style image input.
3. Customizable parameters such as style weight, content weight, and number of optimization steps.
4. Visualization of content, style, and generated output images.
5. Script to save final styled images and intermediate results.

## Use Cases

- Artistic rendering and image stylization  
- Creating personalized artwork  
- Style mixing and experimentation  
- Educational demonstrations of CNN feature representations

## Purpose

This project is ideal for understanding how deep neural networks can separate and recombine image content and style. It leverages pre-trained models and optimization techniques to produce visually compelling, style-transferred images with Python and PyTorch.
